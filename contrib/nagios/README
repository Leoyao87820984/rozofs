1) INSTALL PLUGGINS
___________________

Under "pluggins" directory are the RozoFS Nagios pluggins to be copied under
/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/ where your Nagios runs.


1.1) nagios_rozofs_volume.sh
     _______________________
     
This pluggin is used to monitor the state of a volume id using the rozodebug
interface. It gets as mandatory parameters the host where the Exportd handling 
this volume runs (VIP) and the acceptable critical/warning thresholds for the 
free volume space.
  
The pluggin pings the host of the Exportd and on success requests the Exportd for 
the volume statistics, and checks the status of the storage nodes servicing the volume.

The result is OK when :
  - all storages nodes are up 
AND
  - the free volume space is over the warning threshold.

The result is CRITICAL when :
  - the free volume space is below the critical threshold,
OR
  - no storage node is up

The result is WARNING in all other cases so :
  - the free volume space is between the warning and critical thresholds,
AND/OR
  - some storage nodes but not all are down.  


1.2) nagios_rozofs_storaged.sh
     _________________________
     
This pluggin is used to monitor the state of a storage node using the rozodebug
interface. It gets as mandatory parameter the host of the storage node.

The pluggin pings the storage node and then checks access to the rozodebug
interface of the storaged and each storio of the storage node.

The result is OK       when the storaged and all the storio are up.
The result is WARNING  when some storio is not responding
The result is CRITICAL when the storaged is down or when all storios are down.


1.3) nagios_rozofsmount.sh 
     _____________________
  
This pluggin is used to monitor the state of a RozoFS client using the rozodebug
interface. It gets as mandatory parameters the host of the RozoFS client.

The pluggin pings the host of the RozoFS client.
It checks the status of the rozofsmount interface toward the exportd.
It checks the status of the rozofsmount interfaces toward its 2 storcli. 
It checks the status of the storcli interfaces toward the storage nodes.

The result is OK when :
  - the rozofsmount has its interface toward the Exportd UP
AND
  - the rozofsmount has its 2 interfaces toward the storcli UP
AND
  - the 2 storcli have their interfaces toward the storages UP

The result is CRITICAL when :
  - the rozofsmount is unreachable
OR
  - the rozofsmount has its interface toward the Exportd DOWN 
OR
  - the rozofsmount has one of its interfaces toward a storcli DOWN 
OR
  - one of the storcli has more than one interface DOWN toward a storage node.


The result is WARNING when :
  - the rozofsmount has its interface UP toward the Exportd
AND
  - the rozofsmount has its 2 interfaces up toward the storcli
AND
  - no storcli has more than one interface DOWN toward a storage node.



2) CONFIGURATION FILES
_______________________

Under "cfg" directory stand files related to the Nagios configuration. 

2.1) Modify nagios.cfg
     _________________
     
You should find the Nagios top configuration file on your Nagios server under
/etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg.

Open it and insert at the end the following lines to include the RozoFS configuration 
files.

cfg_file=/etc/nagios3/rozofs_static.cfg
cfg_file=/etc/nagios3/rozofs_dynamic.cfg


2.2) Copy cfg/rozofs_static.cfg
     __________________________
     
This file should be copied under /etc/nagios3/rozofs_static.cfg

It defines the commands to invoke the different pluggins and do not depends on your RozoFS
cluster configuration.

2.3) Copy the logo
     _____________
     
Copy the file cfg/rozofs-128.png under 

/usr/share/nagios/nagios3/htdocs/images/logos/rozofs-128.png
/usr/share/nagios/htdocs/images/logos/logos/rozofs-128.png
/usr/share/nagios/htdocs/images/logos/base/rozofs-128.png


2.3) Generate rozofs_dynamic.cfg
     ___________________________
     
This file has to be generated. Its content depends on the RozoFS cluster configuration. 

The bash cfg/generate_rozofs_dynamic.sh enables you to generate a correct rozofs_dynamic.cfg file. 
The syntax is : cfg/rozofs_dynamic.sh -i input_file 
where input file describe your configuration. This file contains a sequence of command lines
described in the paragraphs hereafter.

2.3.1) VOLUME

For each volume of the RozoFS cluster you should add a VOLUME command line
VOLUME <VIP@> <volume#> <storage1IP@> <storage2IP@> <storage3IP@> <storage4IP@> ...
  
This command tells to monitor volume number <volume#> handled by Exportd reachable at
address <VIP@> (this should be the virtal address of this Exportd). 
After the volume number is a list of storage IP address that service this volume.

2.3.2) STORAGE

For each storage node in the RozoFS cluster you should add a STORAGE command line
STORAGE <hostname>

This command tells to monitor the storage node on host <hostname> (either hostname or IP address).

2.3.3) FSMOUNT

For each RozoFS client you want to monitor, you should add a FSMOUNT command line
FSMOUNT <hostname> <instance#>

This command tells to monitor the RozoFS client instance <instance#> on host <hostname>.

2.3.4) Example

cfg/INPUT_EXAMPLE is an example of RozoFS cluster configuration with 4 storages 
at addresses 192.168.2.1, 192.168.2.2, 192.168.2.3, 192.168.2.4
There is one Exportd at address 192.168.2.1 which handles two volume numbered 1 and 2.
All the storages service the 2 volumes. 
One instances of RozoFS client with instance number 0 is hosted on 192.168.2.1 
while instance 1 is hosted on 192.168.2.2

STORAGE 192.168.2.1
STORAGE 192.168.2.2
STORAGE 192.168.2.3
STORAGE 192.168.2.4
VOLUME  192.168.2.1 1 192.168.2.1 192.168.2.2 192.168.2.3 192.168.2.4
VOLUME  192.168.2.1 2 192.168.2.1 192.168.2.2 192.168.2.3 192.168.2.4
FSMOUNT 192.168.2.1 0
FSMOUNT 192.168.2.2 1
