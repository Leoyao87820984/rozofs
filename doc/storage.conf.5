.SH NAME
storage.conf \- RozoFS storage daemon configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "storage.conf"
is managed thanks to 
.B libconfig
<http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/> and thus complies to the
.B libconfig
grammar.

.SS threads (optional)

Specifies number of threads that can process the disk requests. (default: 2)

.SS nbcores (optional)

Maximum number of core files to keep. (default: 2)

.SS storio (optional)

Specifies if storaged starts one or multiple storio process(es). (default: "single")
       Valid values are :
           - "single"; (one storio for all the listening port(s), it's the default value)
           - "multiple"; (one storio per listening port)

.SS listen (mandatory)

Specifies list of IP(s) (or hostname(s)) and port(s) the storio process must listen to for receiving write and read requests from clients.

    addr: (IP or hostname that the server should listens to)
            - must be a valid IPv4 address or a valid hostname.
            - if "*" is specified storio will listen on any of the interfaces.

    port: (TCP port number (in decimal) to use for storio process)

.SS storages (mandatory)

It's the list of local storage managed by this storaged.
Each storage is identified by the cluster to which belongs the storage (cid) 
and by it's identifier in the cluster (sid). Each pair (cid,sid) must be
unique. The root is the path where data will be stored for this storage.
Under this path stands the logical devices (numbered from 0) on which the
storage will spread the data. The storage writes a new data file on the 
less occupied device. A mapping file stores the choosen device for each
file. The device holding the mapping file is computed from a hash. Although
the number of devices can be increased to scale the storage up, the number
of mapping devices can not change (because of the hash). The mapping files 
have some replica written on the devices following their main device.

    cid: (cluster identifier)
            - must be an integer.
            - should exist in exportd configuration file.

    sid: (storage identifier)
            - must be an integer (between 1 and 255).
            - should exist in exportd configuration file.

    root: (directory path where data will be stored)
            - must be an existing directory.
            - must be unique for each storage managed by this storaged.
	    
    device-total: (total number of devices)
            - must be an integer.
	    
    device-mapper: (number of devices used for file to device mapping)
            - must be an integer.
            - must be lower than or equal to device-total.
            - must never be changed.
	    
    device-redundancy: (number of copies of each file to device mapping file)
            - must be an integer.
            - must be lower than or equal to device-mapper.	    
            - must not be decreased.
