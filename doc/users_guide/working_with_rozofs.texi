The storaged daemon starts with the following command:
@example
# /etc/init.d/rozofs-storaged start
@end example
@noindent To stop the daemon, the following command is used:
@example
# /etc/init.d/rozofs-storaged stop
@end example
@noindent To get the current status of the daemon, the following command is used:
@example
# /etc/init.d/rozofs-storaged status

@noindent To reload the storaged configuration file (@file{storage.conf}) after a
configuration changes, the following command is used:
@example
# /etc/init.d/rozofs-storaged reload
@end example
@noindent To automatically start the storaged daemon every time the system boots,
enterone of the following command lines.

@noindent For Red Hat based systems:

@cindex rozofsmount
@end ifnotdocbook

After installing the rozofsmount (RozoFS Client), you have to mount the RozoFS
exported file system to access the data. 
Two methods are possible: mount manually or automatically.

To manually mount Rozo file system, use the following command:
@example
# rozofsmount -H EXPORT_IP -E EXPORT_PATH MOUNTDIR
@end example

For example, if the exported file system is:
@file{/srv/rozofs/exports/export_1} and @acronym{IP} address for export server
is 192.168.1.100:
@example
$ rozofsmount -H 192.168.1.100 -E
/srv/rozofs/exports/export_1 /mnt/rozofs/fs-1
@end example

To unmount the file system:
@example
$ umount /mnt/rozofs/fs-1
@end example

To automatically mount a Rozo file system, edit the @file{/etc/fstab} file and
add the following line:
@example
$ rozofsmount MOUNTDIR rozofs exporthost=EXPORT_IP,
exportpath=EXPORT_PATH,_netdev 0  0
@end example

For example, if the exported file system is @file{/srv/rozofs/exports/export_1}
and @acronym{IP} address for export server is 192.168.1.100 :
@example
$ rozofsmount /mnt/rozofs/fs1 rozofs\
$ exporthost=192.168.1.100,exportpath=/srv/rozofs/exports/export_1,_netdev
0\  0

RozoFS comes with a command line utility called rozo that aims to automate the
@strong{management} process of a RozoFS platform. Its main purpose is to chain up
the operations required on remote nodes involved on a high level management task
such as stopping and starting the whole platform, add new nodes to the platform
in order to extend the capacity, add new exports on volume etc@dots{}

Rozo is fully independant of RozoFS daemons and processes and is not required
for a fully functional system but when installed aside RozoFS on each involved
nodes it greatly facilitates configuration as it takes care of all the unique
id generation of storage locations, clusters and so on. Despite not being a
monitoring tool, rozo can be however used to get easily a description of the
platform, its status and its configuration.

Rozo uses the running exportd configuration file as a basic platform knowledge,
you can use rozo on any nodes (even not involve in the platform).

You can have an overview of @command{rozo} capabilities and get the help you need by
using the rozo manual

@example
# man rozo
@end example

See below, examples of @command{rozo} usage for common management tasks on a 8 nodes
platform. Each command is launched on the running exportd node.

The output of rozo config let us know each node configuration according to its
role. We especially notice that this platform has one volume with one export
relying on it.

Extend the platform is easy (add nodes) with the @command{rozo expand} command, for
example purpose we will add all the nodes already involved in volume 1

As we added nodes without indicating the volume we want to expand,
@command{rozo} has created a new volume (with id 2) as illustrated in the rozo
