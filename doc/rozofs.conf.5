.SH NAME
rozofs.conf \- RozoFS common configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "rozofs.conf"
is managed thanks to 
.B libconfig
<http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/> and thus complies to the
.B libconfig
grammar.

.SS trashed_file_per_run
Maximum number of file that the remove bins thread of a slave export can remove in a run. A 2 seconds delay occurs between every run. 

.SS core_file_directory
The directory under which the RozoFS modules store their core files in case a crash occurs. 

.SS nb_core_file
Maximum number of core file to keep on this node per RozoFS module type. The older core files are kept while the newest ones are removed. 

.SS storio_multiple_mode
Specifies if storaged starts one or multiple storio process(es).
       Valid values are :
           - "False"
             only storio instance 0 is started. It takes care of every storage instance configured in the storage.conf.
           - "True"
             one storio is started for each cluster declared in the storage.conf file. The storio instance is the cluster number. 

.SS nb_disk_thread
Specifies the number of threads within the STORIO process that can operate the disk read/write.

.SS crc32c_check
Boolean (true or false) indicating if a check (thanks to CRC error detecting code) will be used for detecting accidental changes to raw data.

.SS crc32c_generate
Boolean (true or false) indicating if a checksum must be generated (thanks to CRC error detecting code) for each write request.

.SS crc32c_hw_forced
That boolean (true or false) can be asserted if the information reported by cpuid does not indicates that hardware CRC is supported whilst the current CPU supports it.
This might be the case with VirtualBox.
